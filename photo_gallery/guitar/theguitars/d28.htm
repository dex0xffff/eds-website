		<strong>Company</strong>: Martin<br />
		<strong>Model#</strong>: D28<br />
		<strong>Year</strong>: 1976<br />
		<strong>Description</strong>: I purchased this&nbsp; guitar used in 1978 
		from an individual via a newspaper ad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
		jumped at the chance to pay a mere $600.00, and it was only two years old!&nbsp; 
		After writing the check and exchanging it for the guitar, I asked why he 
		would sell such an incredible instrument, one I had always dreamed of 
		owning.&nbsp; He said that this was the third Martin he had owned.&nbsp; The 
		first two had been damaged beyond repair by the airlines.&nbsp; He was a 
		business man who constantly hopped from coast to coast and took the 
		guitar to play in his motel room to relax. After the second had been 
		destroyed he bought this one and just couldn&#39;t bring himself to take it 
		on a plane and have it destroyed.&nbsp; So, this instrument was left at home and 
		wasn&#39;t getting played.&nbsp; He said that he wanted to buy his daughter, 
		who was about 7 or 8, a piano to learn on and was selling the guitar to 
		raise cash to purchase it. I asked what type of piano he wanted, since 
		I knew some people with used ones he might be interested in.&nbsp; He 
		said thank you, but that he was going to purchase her a new one, a 
		Yamaha Baby Grand...which he intended to put in her room!&nbsp; The guitar was, 
		and still is, in excellent 
		condition, almost mint, with the exception of a few small &quot;belt buckle&quot; 
		scratches on the back. This guitar was made several years before Martin began 
		installing an adjustable truss rod in the neck, but still has great action.&nbsp;To keep it 
		that way, I have kept it tuned down a full step, and strung with medium 
		gauge strings. This combination came in especially handy when I wanted 
		to play songs like &quot;Yesterday&quot; by McCartney or &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; by Neil 
		Young, both of which were recorded in a lower tuning.&nbsp; Now that I 
		have the new Fishman Infinity pickup/preamp in my Gibson J100, I keep my 
		Guild JF30 tuned down a whole step to play these songs.&nbsp; This means 
		that I can now keep this Martin tuned to pitch, but with Martin M2000 
		Extra Light gauge strings on it to keep the neck healthy! I play 
		this guitar at home exclusively now, but I plan to use it for recording 
		in the future.&nbsp; The guitar&#39;s voice and&nbsp;tone have aged 
		beautifully and would most certainly make Mr. Martin proud.&nbsp;&nbsp; The price 
		paid included the original blue hardshell Martin case.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
