		<span class="style12">Interview</span> <span class="style12">with Edward 
		Sparks, October 2008</span><strong><span class="style10"><br />
		<br />
		<em>What made you take up the guitar, and how long have you been 
		playing?</em><br />
		<br />
		<span class="style13">I saw the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show…I know 
		that sounds so cliché but its true! I was in the 4th grade and that one 
		moment sparked my passion! I began playing when I was about 12 or 13 
		years old. </span><br />
		<br />
		<em>What was your first guitar and what was the first song you learned 
		to play?</em><br />
		<br />
		My very first guitar was a plastic bodied Tiger Guitar by the Emenee toy 
		company. My first wooden guitar was a parlor sized red Harmony Stella 
		H933 acoustic. Like millions of other budding guitarists, I talked my 
		parents into buying me a Harmony guitar to learn on. I loved that guitar 
		and still own it to this day, (check out the pictures of both on the 
		Guitar Gallery Page). <br />
		<br />
		The very first song I learned all the way through was by Creedence 
		Clearwater Revival, it was called “Lookin’ Out My Back Door.” I bought 
		the sheet music and just playing it over and over until my fingers 
		actually bled. Later I learned how to tune!<br />
		<br />
		<em>What was the first serious guitar you purchased and the last one you 
		purchased?</em><br />
		<br />
		A Harmony Sovereign 6 string acoustic. It was the same model that John 
		Sebastian played at Woodstock, and Pete Townsend of the Who owned a 12 
		string model. They were made in America and all solid wood. I still have 
		that guitar today as well. <br />
		Recently all four of my harmony guitars appeared in Vintage Guitar 
		magazine in a picture captioned “Four Part Harmony.” I currently own the 
		two originals mentioned above and two archtops. <br />
		<br />
		The last guitar I purchased was a Gibson J100extra, for a vendor at the 
		Philadelphia Vintage Guitar Show in 2006. It is a 1994 Centennial Model 
		and celebrates the 100th Birthday of the Gibson Company.<br />
		<br />
		<em>Do you also build guitars yourself?</em><br />
		<br />
		Yes, I have made several instruments over the past 20 or so years, but 
		never for sale...I build only for myself, family, and friends.&nbsp; My 
		first build was a kit bass...kind of a Fender
		<a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/emsparks/photo_gallery/guitar/theguitars/ffb1.htm">
		Tele bass</a> look-a-like made from kit parts.&nbsp; It has a real 
		Fender Tele bass pickup and I still use it a lot today on stage. My 
		first handmade instrument was a 6 string solid body
		<a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/emsparks/photo_gallery/guitar/theguitars/pm1.htm">
		electric mandolin</a>...it was a success...well, kinda!&nbsp; It has a 
		permanent residence in my living room now and makes a great conversation 
		piece.&nbsp; My next project was an 8 string acoustic/electric
		<a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/emsparks/photo_gallery/guitar/theguitars/Sparks8.htm">
		tenor guitar</a>, which is basically a 12 string small bodied guitar 
		without the low E and A strings and their octaves...it came out quite 
		good and I still play it today.&nbsp; My next instrument was the one I 
		am most proud of...a semi-solid
		<a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/emsparks/photo_gallery/guitar/theguitars/Sparks12.htm">
		electric 12 string</a> just caked with with custom features.&nbsp; I 
		used this instrument extensively in Free Flight.&nbsp; I next built a 
		six string neck for my Washburn banjo, and even though it turned out 
		great, I just didn&#39;t like the way the instrument sounded...and I missed 
		my 5 string banjo!&nbsp; I am saving this neck for a solid body electric 
		build I have in the drawing board stages right now!&nbsp; I began work 
		on a
		<a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/emsparks/photo_gallery/guitar/theguitars/lap.htm">
		lapsteel</a>, which is still in pieces.&nbsp; I stopped the lapsteel 
		work, and enlisted the help of my friend and partner Patrick Raymond, of 
		Raymond Guitars,&nbsp; to build a special
		<a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/emsparks/photo_gallery/guitar/theguitars/model21.htm">
		bass</a> for my son Josh&#39;s 21st birthday.&nbsp; My current project is 
		building an electric guitar for my son Phil.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may click 
		on the imbedded links here, but be sure to visit the
		<a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/emsparks/photo_gallery/guitar/guitar_gallery.htm">
		Guitar Gallery</a> page and view these instruments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
		<br />
		<em>How long have you been performing live and what bands have you been 
		in?</em><br />
		<br />
		I have been playing out now since 1978 when I played in a duo first 
		called “The Fresh Produce Company,” then shorted to “Fresh Produce.’ My 
		partner was Jim Bergendahl, a High School friend. Too many people 
		thought we were a Bluegrass Band, so we changed it to “Free Flight.” We 
		held that name until we got two other members and then changed it to 
		“The Free Flight Band.” That lasted until 2003 when we did out last 
		show. I am currently in a trio called “Sparks, Raymond &amp; McCoy.” I am 
		also playing solo these days and with other people on the side, 
		including my son and step-son. <br />
		<br />
		<em>What&#39;s spinning in your CD player lately?</em><br />
		<br />
		I have to admit to being very narrow minded when it comes to what I 
		listen to...just ask Steve McCoy and Patrick Raymond, my two SRM 
		bandmates!&nbsp; Right now in my car player I have a great CD by my 
		friend <a href="http://www.joerathbone.com/">Joe Rathbone</a> called &quot;I 
		Can Hear the Windows of Your Heart Breaking.&quot;&nbsp; It is a masterpiece 
		and I love everything about it, the lyrics the melodies, the 
		arrangements, just everything!&nbsp; He plays mostly guitar, but among 
		the typical drums and keyboards and bass, he has a cello and violin. I 
		currently cover his song from the album called &quot;Learning to Fly.&quot;&nbsp; 
		Really great stuff.&nbsp; Other than that I listen to my old favorites, 
		the Beatles, Byrds, C~S~N &amp; Y, Cat Stevens, Harry Chapin, John Gorka, 
		and others.&nbsp; I also fell in love with the soundtrack to the movies:&nbsp; 
		&quot;Across the Universe&quot;, &quot;Autumn Rush&quot; and &quot;Elizabethtown.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
		have also been listening to a lot of my old stuff lately as I am working 
		on a new album of old songs called &quot;Ghosts of Sessions Past.&quot;&nbsp; It 
		will include a bunch of my old stuff, both studio and live, solo and 
		duo/trio, as well as a group of songs that I have never released.&nbsp; 
		I had hoped to have it out at Christmas this year, but I have had some 
		software setbacks!&nbsp; When it is finished it will be announced on my 
		&quot;NEWS&quot; page.<br />
