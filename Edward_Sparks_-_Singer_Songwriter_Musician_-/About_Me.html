                  <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_3">I was born in Macon, Georgia in November 1955.  Macon was the home of famous musicians “Little Richard” Pennimen, The Allman Brothers Band and Otis Redding, among others.  The #1 song that year was “Rock Around the Clock” by Bill Haley &amp;The Comets. Bill Haley, the front man for the band, was a guitarist and one of the early pioneers of ‘white’ Rock and Roll.  My parents moved to Maryland when I was 3.  My mother was a homemaker and my father owned “Sparks Painting &amp; Decorating Co.”My mother was also a fine artist, a poet and she loved music.  I was the kind of kid who was caught drawing a mural on the wall behind the couch!  I loved punch-out books, drawing and bi-planes.  Then, in 1963, two memorable events shaped our history. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, and the Beatles, with much fanfare, first arrived in America.<span style="line-height: 16px; " class="style_2"><br /></span></p>

I was in the 4th grade and that one moment sparked my passion! I began playing when I was about 12 or 13 years old. </span><br /><br /><span class="style_4">What was your first guitar and what was the first song you learned to play?</span><br /><br /><span class="style_5">My very first guitar was a plastic bodied Tiger Guitar by the Emenee toy company. My first wooden guitar was a parlor sized red Harmony Stella H933 acoustic. Like millions of other budding guitarists, I talked my parents into buying me a Harmony guitar to learn on. I loved that guitar and still own it to this day, (check out the pictures of both on the Guitar Gallery Page). <br /><br />The very first song I learned all the way through was by Creedence Clearwater Revival, it was called “Lookin’ Out My Back Door.” I bought the sheet music and just playing it over and over until my fingers actually bled. Later I learned how to tune!</span><br /><span class="style_4"><br />What was the first serious guitar you purchased and the last one you purchased?<br /></span><span class="style_5"><br />A Harmony Sovereign 6 string acoustic. It was the same model that John Sebastian played at Woodstock, and Pete Townsend of the Who owned a 12 string model. They were made in America and all solid wood. I still have that guitar today as well. <br />Recently all four of my harmony guitars appeared in Vintage Guitar magazine in a picture captioned “Four Part Harmony.” I currently own the two originals mentioned above and two archtops. <br /><br />The last guitar I purchased was a Gibson J100extra, for a vendor at the Philadelphia Vintage Guitar Show in 2006. It is a 1994 Centennial Model and celebrates the 100th Birthday of the Gibson Company.<br /><br /></span><span class="style_4">Do you also build guitars yourself?</span><br /><span class="style_5"><br />Yes, I have made several instruments over the past 20 or so years, but never for sale...I build only for myself, family, and friends.  My first build was a kit bass...kind of a Fender </span><a title="http://mysite.verizon.net/emsparks/photo_gallery/guitar/theguitars/ffb1.htm" href="http://mysite.verizon.net/emsparks/photo_gallery/guitar/theguitars/ffb1.htm" class="style_6">Tele bass</a><span class="style_5"> look-a-like made from kit parts.  It has a real Fender Tele bass pickup and I still use it a lot today on stage. My first handmade instrument was a 6 string solid body </span><a title="http://mysite.verizon.net/emsparks/photo_gallery/guitar/theguitars/pm1.htm" href="http://mysite.verizon.net/emsparks/photo_gallery/guitar/theguitars/pm1.htm" class="style_6">electric mandolin</a><span class="style_5">...it was a success...well, kinda!  It has a permanent residence in my living room now and makes a great conversation piece.  My next project was an 8 string acoustic/electric </span><a title="http://mysite.verizon.net/emsparks/photo_gallery/guitar/theguitars/Sparks8.htm" href="http://mysite.verizon.net/emsparks/photo_gallery/guitar/theguitars/Sparks8.htm" class="style_6">tenor guitar</a><span class="style_5">, which is basically a 12 string small bodied guitar without the low E and A strings and their octaves...it came out quite good and I still play it today.  My next instrument was the one I am most proud of...a semi-solid </span><a title="http://mysite.verizon.net/emsparks/photo_gallery/guitar/theguitars/Sparks12.htm" href="http://mysite.verizon.net/emsparks/photo_gallery/guitar/theguitars/Sparks12.htm" class="style_6">electric 12 string</a><span class="style_5"> just caked with with custom features.  I used this instrument extensively in Free Flight.  I next built a six string neck for my Washburn banjo, and even though it turned out great, I just didn't like the way the instrument sounded...and I missed my 5 string banjo!  I am saving this neck for a solid body electric build I have in the drawing board stages right now!  I began work on a </span><a title="http://mysite.verizon.net/emsparks/photo_gallery/guitar/theguitars/lap.htm" href="http://mysite.verizon.net/emsparks/photo_gallery/guitar/theguitars/lap.htm" class="style_6">lapsteel</a><span class="style_5">, which is still in pieces.  I stopped the lapsteel work, and enlisted the help of my friend and partner Patrick Raymond, of Raymond Guitars,  to build a special </span><a title="http://mysite.verizon.net/emsparks/photo_gallery/guitar/theguitars/model21.htm" href="http://mysite.verizon.net/emsparks/photo_gallery/guitar/theguitars/model21.htm" class="style_6">bass</a><span class="style_5"> for my son Josh's 21st birthday.  My current project is building an electric guitar for my son Phil.   You may click on the imbedded links here, but be sure to visit the </span><a title="http://mysite.verizon.net/emsparks/photo_gallery/guitar/guitar_gallery.htm" href="http://mysite.verizon.net/emsparks/photo_gallery/guitar/guitar_gallery.htm" class="style_6">Guitar Gallery</a><span class="style_5"> page and view these instruments.         <br /><br /></span><span class="style_4">How long have you been performing live and what bands have you been in?<br /></span><span class="style_5"><br />I have been playing out now since 1978 when I played in a duo first called “The Fresh Produce Company,” then shorted to “Fresh Produce.’ My partner was Jim Bergendahl, a High School friend. Too many people thought we were a Bluegrass Band, so we changed it to “Free Flight.” We held that name until we got two other members and then changed it to “The Free Flight Band.” That lasted until 2003 when we did out last show. I am currently in a trio called “Sparks, Raymond &amp; McCoy.” I am also playing solo these days and with other people on the side, including my son and step-son. <br /></span><br /><span class="style_4">What's spinning in your CD player lately?<br /></span><span class="style_5"><br />I have to admit to being very narrow minded when it comes to what I listen to...just ask Steve McCoy and Patrick Raymond, my two SRM bandmates!  Right now in my car player I have a great CD by my friend </span><a title="http://www.joerathbone.com/" href="http://www.joerathbone.com/" class="style_6">Joe Rathbone</a><span class="style_5"> called &quot;I Can Hear the Windows of Your Heart Breaking.&quot;  It is a masterpiece and I love everything about it, the lyrics the melodies, the arrangements, just everything!  He plays mostly guitar, but among the typical drums and keyboards and bass, he has a cello and violin. I currently cover his song from the album called &quot;Learning to Fly.&quot;  Really great stuff.  Other than that I listen to my old favorites, the Beatles, Byrds, C~S~N &amp; Y, Cat Stevens, Harry Chapin, John Gorka, and others.  I also fell in love with the soundtrack to the movies:  &quot;Across the Universe&quot;, &quot;Autumn Rush&quot; and &quot;Elizabethtown.&quot;   I have also been listening to a lot of my old stuff lately as I am working on a new album of old songs called &quot;Ghosts of Sessions Past.&quot;  It will include a bunch of my old stuff, both studio and live, solo and duo/trio, as well as a group of songs that I have never released.  I had hoped to have it out at Christmas this year, but I have had some software setbacks!  When it is finished it will be announced on my &quot;NEWS&quot; page.<br /></span></p>
